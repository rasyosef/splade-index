Fossil fuel based natural gas is a non-renewable resource.[3]\n",

Petroleum is another resource and fossil fuel found in close proximity to and with natural gas. Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms: biogenic and thermogenic. Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes, bogs, landfills, and shallow sediments. Deeper in the earth, at greater temperature and pressure, thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material.[4][5]\n",
            "Rank 3 (score: 16.60) (doc_id: 68795): Natural gas prices Depending on the marketplace, the price of natural gas is expressed in US dollars (or other currency) per 1 million British thermal units (MMBtu), thousand cubic feet (Mcf), or 1,000 cubic meters. Note that, for natural gas price comparisons, $ per MMBtu multiplied by 1.025 = $ per Mcf of pipeline-quality gas, which is what is delivered to consumers. For rough comparisons, one million Btu is approximately equal to a thousand cubic feet of natural gas.[6] Pipeline-quality gas has a BTU value slightly higher than that of pure methane, which has 1,012 BTU per cubic foot. Natural gas as it comes out of the ground is most often predominantly methane, but may have a wide range of BTU values, from much lower (due to dilution by non-hydrocarbon gasses) to much higher (due to the presence of ethane, propane, and heavier compounds) than standard pipeline-quality gas.[7]\n",
            "Rank 4 (score: 16.41) (doc_id: 36817): Renewable energy in Australia Renewable energy in Australia deals with efforts that have been and continue to be made in Australia to quantify and expand the use of renewable energy in the generation of electricity, as fuel in transport and in thermal energy. Renewable energy is created through electricity generation using renewable sources, such as wind, hydro, landfill gas, geothermal, solar PV and solar thermal. Total renewable energy consumption in Australia in 2015 was 346 petajoules (9.6Ã—1010Â kWh) (PJ), 5.9% of Australia's total energy consumption;[1] compared to consumption of 265PJ in 2011/12, 4.3% of Australia's total energy consumption.[2] Of all renewable energy consumption in 2015 (in order of contribution) biomass (wood, woodwaste and bagasse) represented 53%, hydroelectricity 19.2%, wind 10.7%, solar PV 5.1%, biogas 4.7%, solar hot water 3.8% and biofuels 3.6%.[3] Bioenergy (the sum of all energy derived from plant matter) represented 61.3% (211.9PJ) of Australia's total renewable energy consumption in 2015.[3]\n",
            "Rank 5 (score: 16.02) (doc_id: 63061): Fuel Conventional diesel is similar to gasoline in that it is a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons extracted from petroleum. Kerosene is used in kerosene lamps and as a fuel for cooking, heating, and small engines. Natural gas, composed chiefly of methane, can only exist as a liquid at very low temperatures (regardless of pressure), which limits its direct use as a liquid fuel in most applications. LP gas is a mixture of propane and butane, both of which are easily compressible gases under standard atmospheric conditions. It offers many of the advantages of compressed natural gas (CNG), but is denser than air, does not burn as cleanly, and is much more easily compressed. Commonly used for cooking and space heating, LP gas and compressed propane are seeing increased use in motorized vehicles; propane is the third most commonly used motor fuel globally.\n"
